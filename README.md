# Adventure App
A Flutter application developed for unit 7 (mobile applications development) and unit 9 (project management)

## About
This project was created for two units for my college course. Unit 7 - Mobile applications development, and Unit 9 - Project Management. My task was to develop a mobile application in a framework of my choice, following a brief, while working under the management of a project manager. The project manager was responsible for prducing UI designs, a story board, and a flow chart which I then used when developing the app.

## The Brief
Choose Your Adventure Games is a world famous games publisher known for publishing choose your own adventure books, whereby a user selects an option and is then guided to the next set of options via page numbers. The company is looking to produce their first mobile app. The company has reached out to Callywith Apps, to help them envisage what this app might look like. 
They have asked you to produce a demo app showcasing your app development skills. They are particularly interested in the unique ways in which users can interact with a mobile app. 
The company has outlined the following requirements: 
* Suitable title screen
* At least 5 different questions, each one of which leads to one of two possible outcomes.
* Each question should have a unique input style, such as orientation, shake, seekbar etc.
* 4 different endings, each with unique media, such as trophies or medals and a score
* Media presented with each choice, could be an image or a video
* Options at the end of the game to retry or to share their score with friends
